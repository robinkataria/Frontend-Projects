### About

**Login-Signup** are styled HTML pages for login and sign up on a web-app. At often places, Javascript is used to add form validations, password view-hide toggle function and multiple other event listeners.

I have developed these pages by referring to below [ðŸ”—Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16502934-Sign-up-Log-in) design.
